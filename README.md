This repo has the basics for creating a basic website using Terraform. 

In the terraform folder, you will find the basic outline of creating a small GCP VM.
In the website_resources folder, you will find a basic HTML/CSS website. I used my mini-portfolio as an example!
Feel free to edit the main.tf file to point to your website's git repo. Make sure it can run on an Apache2 web server.
